* Zalando Tech History

* Why Go
- For a lot of reasons you probably know
- Static typing
- Static binaries
- We can build lightweight components for our Infrastructure 
- Stable enough, improves at every release (i.e. GC)
- Nice concurrency
- ... simple and readable

* Platform @ Zalando 
We are using Go for any new tool we build:

- Baboon-proxy (F5 proxy)
- Gin middlewares (Oauth2, monitoring, logging)
- Chimp (Opinionated cli/server tool for Kubernetes/Marathon)
- ... many more!

* The Shop and Skipper

* The Shop and Skipper
We started rebuilding the Shop, Zalando's main customer facing web site.

One of our goals was to enable independent teams working
on the same web frontend:

- Independent development/deployment cycles
- Independent code base
- Consistent user experience

Go just sneaked in to our toolset...

* Mosaic infrastructure

Pages are composed from fragments.

Fragments are like microservices for web frontend.

Key components of the supporting infrastructure:

- Routing
- Layout composition
- Component library

* Skipper - HTTP "Router"

For one: a multipurpose HTTP network tool.
Also: the router component from the "MVC" terminology, as a service.

* Skipper - Inception

Prototyping with Vulcand: awesome design, but not flexible enough

Three competing solutions:

- Nginx with Lua
- Scala/Akka
- Skipper

The Go http stack + Skipper's design came out winner.

* Skipper - Main features

- By default, just a reverse proxy
- Filters control the request flow
- Routing updated on the fly
- Extension points: predicates, filters, data sources
- Eskip: route definition language

.code example.eskip

* Skipper - Seeds of Tooling

- Eskip - included
- Parskip (Haskell) by Moritz Grauel - https://github.com/mo-gr/parskip
- Syntax highlighting by Dmitriy Kubyshkin - https://github.com/grassator/eskip.tmbundle

Production experience coming...

* Go, Zalando, Open Source

* Making our Go code Open and reusable
- "Open Source first" - when appropriate
- Code is designed to be usable outside Zalando
- "Compilation over configuration" (with build tags) 
.code interface.go

* Making our Go code Open and reusable
.code impl.go

* That's it
- Go will keep growing at Zalando
- Increase participation in Meetups :-)
- Internal trainings planned
- ... you can help us (we are hiring!)
